						definition?
						code that runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may only last for one invocation), and fully managed by a 3rd party
						 - to paraphrase Mike Roberts paraphrasing Thoughtworks
					</section>
					<section>
						Event-driven, stateless functions as a service
						<br>
						Meaning they respond to some action, chew some input, spit out the output and die. And that Amazon takes care of everything in the cloud.

						<h4>The benefits of Lambda for you</h4>
						<p>Big picture: think about your services rather than your infrastructure (horizontal scaling, high availability etc.). Save time, money and the planet</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>What do we compare it to</h4>
						<p>EC2 or heroku<p>

						<h3>when?</h3>

						Scheduled jobs

						OR your entire back-end and everything else ever
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>how?</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						you need a service that will insult your users, so you write a library to do it
						<br>
						<br>
						insult.js
						<pre><code>module.exports = function (username) {
	return username + 'is a ninny';
}</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						now of course you need this to be a microservice available over http, so you turn to the power of lambda!
						<br>
						<br>
						insulting-lambda.js
						<pre><code>var insult = require('./insult');
exports.handler = function (event, context, callback) {
	context.succeed(insult(event.username));
}</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						zip it and upload it to aws using aws-cli (properly configured) and an IAM role (important)
						<pre><code>$ zip insultr insultr.js // actually need to include its dependencies
$ aws lambda create-function --region eu-west-1 \
	--function-name insultr
	--zip-file fileb://path/to/insultr.zip
	--role role-arn
	--handler insultr.handler
	--runtime nodejs4.3</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						In its simplest form
						<br>
						you write a handler function which takes a certain number of arguments,
						<br>
						zip it
						<br>
						upload it to amazon (cli, but you can use console)
						<br>
						check it in the console and test it with some dummy json.
						<br>
						of course, this has no trigger. Triggers can be many things.

						Things to make it nicer
					</section>
					<section>
						Java... umm
					</section>
					<section>
						python api - chalice
						<br>
						simple and beaut - bound to be more of this in the coming while
					</section>
					<section>
						node - serverless (formally jaws)
						<br><br>
						sorts of presets you can get & screenshot
					</section>
					<section>
						Node and Go - apex
						<br>
						Apex is what I'd recommend most. It's from the guy who did Express, lets you do go automatically, provides a nice abstraction around building a project out of many little functions while versioning it all and deploying it all and env variables and node modules and logs, too. it's cool.
					</section>
					<section>
						node-lamda for lightweight deploy and test
					</section>
					<section>
						Other languages: if it's on the JVM you shoul be able to do something. or you can compile a binaty and execute it with node, which is cool and prob see a lot of
					</section>

						graphQL
